After git clone'ing this repo, do the following to get the site running locally at http://localhost:3000\r\n\r\n```\r\nbundle install\r\nrake db:migrate\r\nrails server\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. I'm using the HTML5 editablecontent div/span attribute to allow for in-place text editing, so if your browser doesn't support HTML5, it won't work\r\n3. I used [this tutorial](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) to build the backend\r\n4. You can go to http://localhost:3000/posts (and other posts-related resource URLs) to experience a non-Backbone version of the site\r\n5. I've turned off the csrf protection so that the AJAX PUT/POST calls will work without Rails denying the requests\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
